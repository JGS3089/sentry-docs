The main (or UI) thread in a mobile app is responsible for handling all user interaction and needs to be able to respond to gestures and taps in real time. If a long-running operation blocks the main thread, the app becomes unresponsive, impacting the quality of the user experience.

We can detect some specific causes for a main thread stall, like decoding [images](LINK) or [JSON](LINK), or [searching strings with regexes](LINK), but there are arbitrarily many things that could cause one. If a main thread stall occurs that doesn't match one of our specific detectors, but is causing your app to drop UI frames, it gets reported under this generic issue type.

## Detection Criteria

[Profiling](/product/profiling/) must be enabled for Sentry to detect Long Task Causing Frame Drop issues. Sentry looks for profiles that recorded a [frozen](LINK) UI frame, and then searches for the bottom-most function call from application code that persisted for the longest time while the display link waited to draw the frozen frame.

## Function Evidence

To find additional information about your Long Task Causing Frame Drop problem, go to its **Issue Details** page and scroll down to the "Function Evidence" section, which shows the following:

- **Transaction Name:** The name of the transaction where the issue was detected.
- **Suspect function:** The function that triggered the issue detection.
- **Duration:** How long the function took to execute and the number of consecutive samples collected by the profiler that contained the function.

To view the entire profile associated with the issue, click the “View Profile” button.

The profile will indicate where the suspect function was called from, along with other functions being called _by_ the suspect function:

## Stack Trace

The “Stack Trace” section shows a full stack trace for where the detected image decoding function was called from:
